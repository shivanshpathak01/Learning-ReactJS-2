-> In Redux reducers, the payload refers to the data being sent to update the state. It is typically passed within the action object when dispatching an action.
ex: dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT", payload: 5 }); // count will increase by 5

-> What is dispatch in Redux?
In Redux, dispatch is a function used to send (or dispatch) actions to the Redux store. It triggers the reducer function, which updates the state based on the action.

How dispatch Works:
You call dispatch() with an action object.
The action is sent to the Redux reducer.
The reducer updates the store based on the action type and payload.
The UI re-renders with the new state.

-> What is a Reducer in Redux?
A reducer is a pure function in Redux that takes the current state and an action as input and returns a new state based on the action type
✔ Reducers do not modify the existing state; they return a new state.
✔ They must be pure functions (i.e., they do not mutate the state, perform API calls, or have side effects).
✔ They handle actions that are dispatched to update the Redux store.
